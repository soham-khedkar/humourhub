            Welcome to our Privacy Policy page! Just like your ex, we respect your privacy.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We promise not to stalk you... unless you post really bad memes. Then we might have to.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. Like, we need to know your name so we can call you out when your memes are trash.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We don’t share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, except when required to by law or if you post a meme that’s so bad it becomes a crime.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Our website may link to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a link to a sketchy site and get a virus, that's on you, buddy.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            You are free to refuse our request for your personal information, with the understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services. Like, we can't send you dank memes if we don't know where to send them.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Your continued use of our website will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact us. But seriously, who reads these things anyway?
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This policy is effective as of 1 January 2025 (sike we in the future bro). But let's be real, it probably won't change until the next meme apocalypse.
